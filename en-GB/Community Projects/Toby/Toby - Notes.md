#Introduction:
In this project, we are going to create a simple game in which Toby the dog has to collect 5 cheese-puffs bowls to win, whilst preventing balls from falling on the floor. If Toby drops more than 2 balls, the game is over.

#Resources
For this project, Scratch 2 should be used. Scratch 2 can either be used <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/">online</a> or <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/scratch2download/">offline</a>.

You can find a completed version of this project <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/projects/49677948/#editor">online</a>, or it can be downloaded by clicking the 'Download Project Materials' link for this project, which contains:

#Learning Objectives
+ Controlling the dog sprite with the arrow keys
+ Consolidating random numbers, variables, and events
+ Making a ball bounce, and detecting collisions

#Challenges
+ "Sound effects" - adding sound and music to the game
+ "Make the game more challenging" - understanding which parameters need to be changed to make the game more difficult
+ "Add a new level" - Add a level 2 to the game, with a new background and more balls

#Frequently Asked Questions
+ For this project, it is assumed that the children know how to import new sounds.
+ Remind the children to make sure that the centre is set correctly on the ball's costume. If the children use the costume editor to reduce the size of their sprites, the centre will often be shifted after resizing. Clicking on the **shrink** icon instead is a better option as it doesn't affect the centre of the costume.
