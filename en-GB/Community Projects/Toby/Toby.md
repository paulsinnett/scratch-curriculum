# Introduction { .intro}

In this project, we are going to create a game in which Toby the dog has to collect 5 cheese-puffs bowls to win, whilst preventing balls from falling on the floor. 
If Toby drops more than 2 balls, the game is over. So the question is: can you keep all the balls in the air?

# **Step 1:** Controlling Toby {.activity}

## Activity Checklist { .check}

+ Start a new Scratch project. Delete the cat by right-clicking it and selecting Delete.

+ Click on the stage. Choose a backdrop from the Scratch library: the **night city with street** backdrop is a good choice for this project. Delete the original blank backdrop.

+ Add a new sprite. select the **Dog2** sprite from the **Animals** section.

+ **Dog2** comes with three costumes. Delete the third costume **dog2-c** as we only want the first two.

+ Click on the blue `i` {.blockmotion} button to the top left of the sprite picture. Rename the sprite __Toby__ 

+ Select the `left-right rotation style` {.blockmotion} as shown on the picture below:

	![screenshot](Toby_Sprite.png)

+ We want Toby to move right when we press the right arrow key. Click on the scripts tab, and add this script:

	```blocks
		when FLAG clicked    
		switch backdrop to [night city with street v]   
		forever
		if <key [right arrow v] pressed?> then
		point in direction (90 v)
		move (10) steps
		next costume
		end
		end            
	```


+ Click on the Green Flag, and check that Toby can move right when you press the right arrow key. Now we need to add more code to allow Toby to move left as well. Add this to your script:

	```blocks
    		when FLAG clicked    
		switch backdrop to [night city with street v]   
        	forever
	   	if <key [right arrow v] pressed?> then
		point in direction (90 v)
		move (10) steps
		next costume
	   	end	
           	if <key [left arrow v] pressed?> then
		point in direction (-90 v)
		move (10) steps
		next costume
	   	end
       		end            
	```

## Test Your Project { .flag}
 
__Click the green flag__, press the left arrow key. Does Toby move left ? Now try the right arrow key!


## Save your project { .save}

# **Step 2:** Keeping Toby busy! {.activity}

Now that Toby can move, let's give him something to do. In order to win the game, Toby must collect 5 cheese-puffs bowls. We need the bowls to appear randomly at different times and places.

## Activity Checklist { .check}

+ Add a new sprite from the library: select the **cheesy-puffs** from the **Things** category, and rename it **bowl**. 

+ Click on the __Costumes__ tab and reduce the size of the cheese-puffs bowl by clicking on the **shrink** icon at the top near the scissors. You then need to click on the bowl sprite to make it smaller. The shrink icon looks like this:

	![screenshot](shrink.png)


+ If you used a different method to resize the bowl, you may need to reset the centre of the costume so that it is at the centre of the bowl. To do this, click on the **Set costume centre** icon at the top right corner, and move the crosshair as shown on the picture below:  

	![screenshot](Set_centre.png)


+ The **cheesy-puffs** need to appear in random places on the pavement. The `y position` {.blockmotion} will remain the same, but the `x position` {.blockmotion} needs to change so that the bowl sometimes appears on the right, on the left, or in the middle. Add the following script to the **bowl** sprite: 

	```blocks
		when FLAG clicked  
		forever
		wait (5) secs
		go to x:(pick random (-220) to (220)) y:(-140)
		end
	```

+ Click the green flag, and wait for a bit. Does the cheese-puffs bowl keep moving to different places every 5 seconds?

+ At the moment, the game is too predictable! Let's make it more difficult by hiding the bowl from time to time. Modify the script in the following way:

	```blocks
		when FLAG clicked  
		hide
		forever
		wait (pick random (1) to (10)) secs
		go to x:(pick random (-220) to (220)) y:(-140)
		show
		wait (pick random (1) to (10)) secs
		hide
		end
	```

## Test Your Project { .flag}


__Click the green flag__, the cheese-puffs bowl should now appear for random lengths of time, and in random places.

## Save your project { .save }

# **Step 3:** Counting the bowls {.activity }

In order to win the game, Toby must collect 5 cheese-puffs bowls. 

## Activity Checklist { .check}

+ Create a `bowls` {.blockdata} variable to keep track of how many bowls Toby has collected so far.

	![screenshot](bowls.png)

+ Now we need to add some code to keep track of how many bowls Toby has collected so far. Each time that Toby touches a cheese-puffs bowl, the `bowls` {.blockdata} variable needs to be increased by 1. So add this script to the cheese-puffs bowl sprite. (Make sure that you keep the previous script as well! We need both scripts)

	```blocks
    		when FLAG clicked  
		set [bowls v] to (0)
        	forever
	  	if <touching [Toby v]?> then
	    	change [bowls v] by (1)
		wait (0.5) secs
		hide
  	  	end	
		end
	```
 
+ The game should be stopped when the number of bowls collected reaches 5. We are going to broadcast a new message called `won` {.blockevents} to the other sprite and the background to let them know that the player has won.
Modify your second script so that it looks like this:

	```blocks
		when FLAG clicked  
		set [bowls v] to (0)
        	forever
		if <touching [Toby v]?> then		
		change [bowls v] by (1)
		if <(bowls) = (5)> then
		broadcast [won v]
		stop [other scripts in sprite v]
		end
		wait (0.5) secs		
		hide
		end	
		end    
	```

+ Add a small script for Toby so that he says 'well done!' when he receives the `won` {.blockevents} message:

	```blocks
		when I receive [won v] 
		say [Well done !] for (2) secs 	     
	```

## Test Your Project { .flag}

__Click the green flag__, does the `bowls` {.blockdata} variable increase each time the dog collects a bowl? Does Toby say "well done" once 5 bowls have been collected?

## Save your project { .save }

## Challenge 1: Adding sound { .challenge}

+ Can you add some code to play a **pop** sound each time a bowl is collected?

+ Can you add a small script for the background so that it changes and plays music when the player wins? 

Hint: You will need to add a script for your stage starting with a `when I receive won` {.blockevents} block
	

## Save your project { .save }

# **Step 4:** Adding a bouncing ball {.activity }

Let's make the game a bit more exciting by adding a bouncing ball!
Toby has to catch the ball. If Toby drops 3 balls before he has time to collect his 5 bowls of cheese-puffs, the game is over!

## Activity Checklist { .check}

+ Add a new sprite: select the **Beachball** from the Scratch library.

+ Shrink the **Beachball**. Make sure that the centre of the costume is set correctly, i.e. at the centre of the ball. You can check this by clicking on the **Set costume centre** icon, located at the top right corner in the **Costumes** tab. It is important to set the centre correctly, as it will affect the way the ball moves.

+ Now we need this ball to fall from the sky, and bounce everywhere. Add the following script to your ball:

	```blocks
		when FLAG clicked  
		show
		go to x:(pick random (-220) to (220)) y:(160)
		point in direction (135 v)
		forever
		move (4) steps
		if on edge, bounce
		end
	```

## Test Your Project { .flag}

__Click the green flag__, your ball should fall from the sky and bounce off the edges of the background. Which number do you need to modify to make the ball bounce faster or slower?

## Save your project { .save }

# **Step 5:** Add more bounce {.activity }

But the problem is: nothing happens when Toby touches the ball. Let's fix this! 

## Activity Checklist { .check}

+ Modify your script so that when the ball touches Toby, it bounces off as well:

	```blocks
		when FLAG clicked  
		show
		go to x:(pick random (-220) to (220)) y:(160)
		point in direction (135 v)
		forever
		move (4) steps
		if on edge, bounce
		if <touching [Toby v]?> then
		turn right (pick random (90) to (270)) degrees
		move (100) steps
	   	end
	 	end
	```

+ We also need to add some code to detect when the ball touches the floor. The ball seems to be touching the floor when its `y position` {.blockmotion} is less than  140. This is an approximate number, and you may need to adjust it, especially if you have chosen a different background. 
We are going to modify the script so that the ball moves back to the top (and changes colour) as soon as it is dropped. Import the **water drop** sound, and modify your script again:

	```blocks
		when FLAG clicked  
		show
 		go to x:(pick random (-220) to (220)) y:(160)
	 	point in direction (135 v)
	 	forever
	   	move (4) steps
	   	if on edge, bounce
	   	if <touching [Toby v]?> then
		turn right (pick random (90) to (270)) degrees
		move (100) steps
	   	end
 	   	if <(y position) < (-140)> then
		change [color v] effect by (25)
		go to x:(pick random (-220) to (220)) y:(160)
		play sound [water drop v]
	   	end
	 	end
	```

## Test Your Project { .flag}

__Click the green flag__, what happens when the ball is dropped ?
Can you see a new ball falling from the top? Is it a different colour?


## Save your project { .save}


# **Step 6:** Counting the dropped balls  {.activity}

## Activity Checklist { .check}

+ We now need to keep track of how many balls Toby has dropped so far. To do this, create a variable for all sprites called `droppedBalls` {.blockdata}.

	![screenshot](droppedBalls.png)

+ When we start the game, Toby has not dropped any balls yet, so we need to initialise the `droppedBalls` {.blockdata} variable to 0. Each time the balls touches the floor, the `droppedBalls` {.blockdata} variable needs to be increased by 1.
When the number of dropped balls is more than 3, the game is over, so we will broadcast a new message called `gameover` {.blockevents} to tell the other sprites and the background that the game is over, and the player has lost. Your **Beachball** script should now look like this: 

	```blocks
		when FLAG clicked  
		set [droppedBalls v] to (0)
		show
 	 	go to x:(pick random (-220) to (220)) y:(160)
	 	point in direction (135 v)
	 	forever
	   	move (4) steps
	   	if on edge, bounce
	   	if <touching [Toby v]?> then
		turn right (pick random (90) to (270)) degrees
		move (100) steps
	   	end
 	   	if <(y position) < (-140)> then
		change [droppedBalls v] by (1)
		if <(droppedBalls) = (3)> then
		broadcast [gameOver v]
		hide
		stop [this script v]
		end	
		change [color v] effect by (25)
		go to x:(pick random (-220) to (220)) y:(160)
		play sound [water drop v]
		end
		end
	```

+ When the players wins, the game should stop, and the ball should stop bouncing and hide:

	```blocks
		when I receive [won v]
		hide
		stop [other scripts in sprite v]
	```


+ Add this script to your **bowl** sprite to stop it from appearing when the game is over:

	```blocks
		when I receive [gameOver v]
		stop [other scripts in sprite v]
	```

+ Click on the stage. Then click on the Sounds tab, and import the **spooky string** sound from the Scratch library, and the **triumph** sound. 

+ Add this script to the stage so that it plays a **spooky string** sound when the game is over:

	```blocks
		when I receive [gameOver v]
		change [color v] effect by (25)
		play sound [spooky string v]
	```
+ Add this script to the stage so that it changes colour several times and plays a **triumph** sound when the player wins:

	```blocks
		when I receive [won v]
		play sound [triumph v]
		repeat (12)
		change [color v] effect by (25)
		wait (0.5) secs
		end
	```
+ Finally, add this script to make sure the colour of the stage comes back to normal when the game is restarted.

	```blocks
		when FLAG clicked
		clear graphic effects
	```

## Test Your Project { .flag}

__Click the green flag__, does the `droppedBalls` {.blockdata} variable increase each time a ball is dropped? Test your game in as many ways that you can think of (winning and losing for example) Does it work as expected?

  
## Save your project { .save}


## Challenge 2: make the game more challenging { .challenge}

What could you do to make the game more challenging? Here are some suggestions:
+ Make the bowls hide more quickly, and for longer. Which parameters do you need to modify to achieve this?  
+ Make the ball move a lot faster, or add another ball: maybe it could be a basketball this time. You can copy the script from the beach ball onto the basketball using drag and drop, there is no need to rewrite the whole script...
+ You could make a level 2 for your game, with a different background, and more balls bouncing around. Instead of collecting cheese-puffs bowls, Toby could this time collect some donuts. (There is a **donut** sprite in the Scratch library). You could create a `level` {.blockdata} variable to keep track of the level you're currently playing.
