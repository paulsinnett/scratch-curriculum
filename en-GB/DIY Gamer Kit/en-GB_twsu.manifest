    "description": "The DIY Gamer Kit is a handheld games console that you can build yourself by soldering together 40 parts on a custom circuit board. Once the build is complete the console, controlled by Arduino, can be programmed to create exciting games. Children are taught how to build their own games console and program it, using materials and videos that have been created especially for the project. Building and programming the DIY Gamer Kit requires no prior knowledge of electronics, soldering or programming. We think itâ€™s suitable for kids that are new to Code Club, or even those who are Scratch or Python pros! You can get hold of a kit at jumpto.cc/diy-kit.",
    "warning": "These projects are recommended by Code Club, as an additional opportunity for children to learn to code. These projects have been produced by Technology Will Save Us - please direct any questions to support@techwillsaveus.com.",
