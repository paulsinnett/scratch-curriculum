# Step 1: Controlling the cat { .activity }

Let's allow the player to control the cat with the arrow keys.

## Activity Checklist { .check }

+ Start a new Scratch project. You can find the online Scratch editor at <a href="http://jumpto.cc/scratch-new">jumpto.cc/scratch-new</a>.

+ Click the 'Shrink' button and then click on the cat a few times to make it a little smaller.

+ To add a background, click 'Choose backdrop from library' and select the 'Stars' backdrop.

	This is how your stage should look:

	![screenshot](sj-stage.png)

+ Let's move the cat to the left when the left arrow key is pressed. 

	Click on your cat sprite, and add the following code:

	```scratch
	when [left arrow v] key pressed?
	change x by (-10)
	```

	Notice that you need to change the x coordinate to move the cat to the left.

	![screenshot](sj-coords.png)

+ Test out your cat by pressing the left arrow key. You should see your cat move towards the left of the stage.

+ To move the cat upwards when the up arrow key is pressed, you'll need to add some more code:

	```scratch
	when [up arrow v] key pressed?
	change y by (10)
	```

+ Test your project again to make sure that your new code works!

## Save your project { .save }

## Challenge: More movement {.challenge}
Can you add more code to your cat sprite, so that it moves up, down, left and right?

## Save your project { .save }

# Step 2: Space junk! { .activity }

Let's add some space junk for the cat to avoid.

## Activity Checklist { .check }

+ Click 'Add new sprite from library' and add the 'Planet2' sprite to your stage. You can change the size of the planet if you want to.

	![screenshot](sj-planet.png)

+ Add this code to make the planet move around the stage forever:

	```scratch
	when flag clicked
	forever
		move (2) steps
		if on edge, bounce
	end
	```

+ Click the green flag to test our your new planet. It should move left and right across the stage.

	Have you noticed that your planet turns upside-down (rotates) when it hits the edge of the screen? To fix this, just add this code to your planet sprite:

	```scratch
	set rotation style [don't rotate v]
	```

+ The game should end when the planet touches the cat, so let's add this code __inside__ the planet's `forever` {.blockcontrol} loop:

	```scratch
	if <touching [Cat1 v]?> then
		stop [all v]
	end
	```

	Here's how your planet's code should look:

	```scratch
	when flag clicked
	forever
		move (2) steps
		if on edge, bounce
		if <touching [Cat1 v]?> then
			stop [all v]
		end
	end
	```

+ Test your game again - does the game end when the planet hits the cat?

## Save your project { .save }

## Challenge: Changing your planet's orbit {.challenge}
Can you change the way your planet moves? You can use these blocks to help you, as well as any other blocks you like.

## Save your project { .save }

# Step 3: Getting back to Earth { .activity }

Can you avoid the space junk for 30 seconds, and get back to Earth safely?

## Activity Checklist { .check }

+ Firstly, let's add the Earth sprite to the center of your stage.

	![screenshot](sj-earth.png)

+ Add this code to your Earth sprite, so that it starts off very small and slowly get's bigger and bigger:

	```scratch
	when flag clicked
	set size to (10) %
	forever
		change size by (0.3)
	end
	```

+ Test out your Earth sprite. It should look as if your cat is slowly floating towards Earth!

	![screenshot](sj-earth-big.png)

+ Click on your stage, and create a new variable to store the time.

	![screenshot](sj-time.png)

	You should now see your timer in the top-left of the stage.

	![screenshot](sj-time-stage.png)

+ Add this code to your stage, so that the timer counts up forever:

	```scratch
	when flag clicked
	forever
		wait (0.1) secs
		change [time v] by (0.1)
	end
	```

+ Click the green flag and you should see your timer start to count up!

	![screenshot](sj-time-test.png)

+ The game is won if the cat can avoid the space junk for 30 seconds.

	For this to work, you just need to set your timer to 0 at the start of the game, and then wait until the timer gets to 30.

	Click on your cat sprite, and add this script:

	```scratch
	when flag clicked
	set [time v] to [0]
	wait until <(time) > [30]>
	say [I made it!] for (2) secs
	stop [all v]
	```

## Save your project { .save }

## Challenge: More space junk {.challenge}
Can you add more enemy sprites to your game, for the cat to avoid? You could add rocks, aliens, or anything else you like!

![screenshot](sj-more-junk.png)

See if you can make each sprite moves differently.

## Save your project { .save }

## Challenge: 2 players {.challenge}
Can you improve your game, so that one of your enemy sprites is controlled by another player? They could use the w, a, s and d keys to control the enemy.

You could even let one of your players use the mouse to control their character. Here are some blocks that may help you:
