Code Club : How to make a river crossing game project By

Emily Harding 

Introduction: In this project we are going to make a game similar to the classic game 

Frogger, your character will jump onto a series of logs to win. 

Step 1 : Create your character and logs

1. Start a new project

2.  First delete the Scratch cat , and import / draw a character.  If you want it to be a classic Frogger style game you can       use a Frog. 

3.  Import / draw your own background. This will be the background which your 
    character will fall into if they miss the log. 

4. Draw 6 rectangles, these will be the ‘logs’ which your character will be hopping on. 
   Make one log then duplicate the rectangle's 5 times. Give each log a name , Log 1 , Log 2 etc.
 

Step 2 : Making the frog move 

1. We want the character to be controlled by the arrow keys to move. Use this 
   script to make the character move to the left: 

When [left arrow v] key pressed 
Change x by (-10)

2. Now you can use this script to make the character move to the right: 

When [right arrow v] key pressed 
Change x by (10)

3. We also want the character to jump forward,onto the logs, so use this script:

When[space v] key pressed 
play sound [Pop 1 v]
move (75) steps 

You can use any sound effect when your character jumps!

4. Finally use this script so your character can move backwards: 

When [down arrow v]key pressed 
if <not <touching color [#00ff00] > > then
move (-75) steps 

The green colour can be replaced with the colour floor your character starts the game on. 

Test your project! Does your character move forward , back , left and right?

Step 3 : Create your background

1. Our character need a background when they are jumping on the logs , start by using the paint fill tool to colour the whole background , you can use any colour you want. 
2. Use the rectangle shape tool, to draw the land your character, and fill the rectangle in. 
3. On your character script page, find the script that moves your character backwards, change the touching colour to the floor colour your character starts on. 
4. Lastly add some waves on to your background. 

Step 4: Programming the logs 

1. Now we are going to programme the logs which your character will be hopping on to cross the river. On Log 1's script page make this script:

when flag clicked  
go to x:(0)y:(-75)
repeat until < (x position) > (280) >
change  x  by(2)
end
forever
go to x:(-300)y:(-75)
repeat until< (x position) > (280) >
change  x  by (2)

2. Also make this script for Log 2 
Test your project: Does Log 1 and 2 both move in a 'right' direction. 

3. Now make this script for Logs 3 and 4 : 

when flag clicked 
go to x:(132) y:(2)
repeat until < (x position) < [-280] >
change x by (-2)
end 
forever
go to x: (137) y:(2)
repeat until<(x position) < [-280] >
change x by (-2) 

Check that your logs 3 and 4 are moving in the left direction.

4. Finally make this script for logs 5 and 6:

when flag clicked 
go to x:(15) y:(87)
repeat until < (x position) < [280] >
change x by (2)
end 
forever
go to x: (15) y:(87)
repeat until<(x position) < [280] >
change x by (2) 

Step 5: We want a goal for our character to reach after jumping on the series of logs, so we need to create a item / place
for our character tio reach. You can create your own area / object for your character to reach or follow these instructions 
to make a lillypad.
